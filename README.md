üêõ Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
"Missing dependency 'xlrd'" Error:
bashpip install xlrd
Excel file not reading properly:

Save as .xlsx format for best compatibility
Ensure data is in a sheet named "Data" for multi-sheet files
Check that headers are in the first row

No group variable detected:

Ensure treatment group column is named clearly (e.g., 'group', 'treatment')
Check that group variable has exactly 2 unique values
Verify data types are correct (numeric for continuous, text for categorical)

Low confidence warnings:

Review variable names for clarity
Add variable descriptions in a separate sheet
Ensure standard clinical trial data structure
